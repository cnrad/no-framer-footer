☑️ _Hide that annoying blue 'free plan' footer in Framer projects_

This is quite possibly the easiest thing I've ever made

## Install on Firefox

[Add to Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-framer-footer/)

## Install on Chrome

I couldn't be bothered to pay the $5 developer registration fee so here are the steps to install:

1. Either clone this repository to your computer, or download the files.
2. Visit `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable __Developer Mode__ (top right)
4. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the directory of the extension contents
5. The extension should be now installed and working.
