☑️ _Hide that annoying blue 'free plan' footer in Framer projects_

This is quite possibly the easiest thing I've ever made

## Install on Firefox

[link will provided soon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0)

For now:

1. Either clone this repository to your computer, or download the files.
2. Visit `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
3. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
4. Navigate to the directory and select the `manifest.json` file
5. The extension should be now installed and working.

## Install on Chrome

I couldn't be bothered to pay the $5 developer registration fee so here are the steps to install:

1. Either clone this repository to your computer, or download the files.
2. Visit `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable __Developer Mode__ (top right)
4. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the directory of the extension contents
5. The extension should be now installed and working.
